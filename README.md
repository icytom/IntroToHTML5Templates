# IntroToHTML5Templates


## Aims and Objectives

#### What is the point and goal of this exercise?
This is a tutorial has two main goals, to get you comfortable with using a template for quick html projects and give you an introduction to using Git hub. It can be a guide for those who are less confident with HTML and a jumping off point for those who are more comfortable.

Templates allow the developer to skip the task of building from scratch and get right into implementing. The template solution is handy for clients who are time or cash strapped (or both).

GitHub is a version control system that helps you to manage your code.

For those who are more experienced, you can take elements and really push your knowledge by adding what you know to an existing set of code.


## Overview

 This is a tutorial on how to skin a responsive html5 template using html in 12 steps whilst keeping track of the changes you make using GitHub.

## Reccommendations based on your current skill level

#### For those less confident:
PLEASE WORK THROUGH THE TUTORIAL. Then use the tutorial as a guide when you are working on your first project. This tutorial will help you become even more comfortable with looking and understanding code. Take the time and work through it. It will make your project less daunting.

#### For those with more confidence:
Work through the tutorial. Or don't. If you feel confident with HTMl, CSS and Github, then more power to you. HOWEVER DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. You can use this tutorial as a way to confirm elements you feel less confident about, or if you get stuck it can be a go to for finding a solution.

If you are more confident (and I know who you are) your Project should be more than just a basic skinned template. Show me what you can do.
